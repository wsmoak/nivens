Nivens
======

Nivens keeps track of all the data from breeding and raising rabbits.

The initial incarnation is a Ruby + Sinatra + mongoDB app.  This is where the data model and API emerged.  Look in the "sinatra-mongo" directory for more info.

There is also initial work done in Node.js + Angular aka the MEAN stack.

Future plans may include

Ruby and Rails
