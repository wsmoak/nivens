Nivens
======

Nivens keeps track of all the data from breeding and raising rabbits.

This is the initial incarnation -- a Ruby + Sinatra + mongoDB app -- where the data model and API emerged.

To run locally, start mongoDB on the default port and execute

$ ruby nivens.rb

Then visit:

http://localhost:4000/rabbit/create
